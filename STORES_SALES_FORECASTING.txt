STORES_SALES_FORECASTING


 Objective

The goal of this project is to predict future sales using past sales data.
This helps businesses plan:

Inventory

Stock levels

Budget

Staffing

Profit targets


Dataset

The dataset contains:

Date → day of sales

Sales → total sales amount


 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

Loaded the CSV file into Python using pandas.

2. Data Cleaning

Removed missing values

Cleaned column names

Converted Date into datetime format

3. Aggregation

Grouped daily sales into monthly/weekly totals.

4. Trend Visualization

Plotted sales over time to see increase or decrease patterns.

5. Seasonality Check

Used rolling mean to understand repeating patterns.

6. Train-Test Split

80% data for training

20% data for testing

This helps test model accuracy properly.

7. Model Building

Used Exponential Smoothing model to forecast sales.

8. Forecasting

Predicted future sales values.

9. Evaluation

Calculated:

MAE → error in units

MAPE → error in percentage

Lower values mean better performance.

10. Export

Saved forecast results into CSV file.

 Results

Sales trend identified clearly

Model predicted future sales successfully

Forecast closely matches actual sales
